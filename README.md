README: Cat Food Inventory Budget App
Introduction
Once upon a time in the bustling town of Whiskerton, there was a popular pet store named Purrfect Supplies. The store was well-loved by the community for its wide selection of pet food and accessories, especially its extensive range of cat food. However, as the store grew, keeping track of the cat food inventory and managing the budget became a challenging task for the owners, Mr. and Mrs. Whiskers.

The Problem
Mr. and Mrs. Whiskers faced a recurring issue: they couldn't accurately monitor the cat food stock or the costs associated with it. With numerous brands and varying prices, they found it difficult to stay within their budget while ensuring they always had enough supply to meet the demand of their feline customers.

The Solution
Determined to solve this problem, Mr. Whiskers decided to develop a Cat Food Inventory Budget App. This app would help them keep a precise record of the cat food coming into the store and track the prices of each item. By using this app, they could easily manage their inventory, forecast future needs, and stay within their budget.
